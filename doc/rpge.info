1.1 About RPGE and this manual
==============================

RPGE is a GNU package, providing an engine for two-dimensional
graphical role playing games. It is driven and extended by writing
programs in GUILE, a dialect of Scheme.  This manual is for RPGE 0.0.1
and aims to document the parts of the workings of RPGE that people
using it should know about, the way RPGE is driven using GUILE and how
RPGE can be obtained, installed and otherwise used.


File: rpge.info,  Node: Getting a copy,  Next: Installation,  Prev: About RPGE and this manual,  Up: About RPGE and obtaining it

1.2 Getting a copy
==================

RPGE can be obtained using anonymous git or from the web. In case you
wish to use anonymous git, the following command creates a local copy
of the RPGE git repository: `git clone
git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/rpge.git'.  Those who prefer the web can
download a copy of a release from the GNU mirrors, a list of which is
kept at <http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html>, or, if necessary, directly
from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org> by FTP.  Either of these options will allow
you to receive a copy of RPGE, but keep in mind that the sources in git
will be more current, but probably also buggier than the releases.


File: rpge.info,  Node: Installation,  Prev: Getting a copy,  Up: About RPGE and obtaining it

1.3 Installation
================

To install RPGE, your system will, at the time of writing (users of Git
are advised to check the file 'README' in the root of the source tree
for possibly updated information), need the following:
   * An ISO C99-compliant C compiler that does not attempt to link when
     passed the -c option

   * A make program compatible with Makefiles produced by GNU configure
     scripts

   * A UNIX shell to execute GNU configure scripts

   * GNU sed

   * The SimpleDirectmediaLayer libraries and development files,
     including the sdl-image and sdl-ttf libraries

   * GUILE, including the development files and libraries, 1.8 or
     later. Several versions in the 1.8 series still appear to break
     RPGE. Version 1.8.5 appears to work, at least on x86.

   If you have the above dependencies, you can install RPGE by moving
to the directory containing the source code and running `./configure &&
make' to build RPGE.  Once the build is complete and error-free, RPGE
can be installed by running `make install' as a user with administrator
privileges.

2.1 A summary of command-line options
=====================================

RPGE is invoked on the command-line using `RPGE OPTIONS' in which
options is one or more of the following, with their required arguments:
   * -v or -version: Prints version information and exits.

   * -h or -help: Prints a summary of usage and options and exits.

   * -f FILE: Changes the default initialization file handled at
     startup from .RPGE to FILE


File: rpge.info,  Node: RPGE initialization files,  Prev: A summary of command-line options,  Up: Invoking RPGE

2.2 RPGE initialization files
=============================

Once started, RPGE parses command-line options, initializes the
libraries it uses and, before entering the frame loop, processes an
initialization file.  This file, .RPGE by default, contains the names
of files containing Scheme code for RPGE to execute, one per line, in
sequence. Any lines starting with '#' are ignored.

   This facility is used in the sample files to include several common
Scheme files. It is advised to use these files, since they provide
common interfaces for matters like dealing with events, handling the
statistics of mobs and a generic table type. However, it is certainly
possible and sometimes useful to replace them. Keep in mind that
anything that depends on other files should be loaded after them.

   Files loaded by initialization files may create threads, for example
to load a certain mechanism to handle events in a loop. To do so,
declare (use-modules (ice-9 threads)) at the start of your file and use
(make-thread safe-load FILENAME) to load the file.  The safe-load
procedure is a RPGE primitive, which uses a load mutex to ensure that
no concurrent loads happen. Since looping mechanisms may run forever,
such files should define all their procedures and call (unlock-mutex
load-mutex) just before entering their main loops. This ensures that
the background script is loaded properly and new loads can happen
safely.

   When loading a file referenced in an initialization file, RPGE looks
for it in the current directory first, after which it checks through a
sequence of scheme paths. These are directories that may contain scheme
code. By default, this sequence is empty on startup. To fill the
sequence, use a so-called colon directive in your initialization file,
of the form `scheme-dir:DIRECTORY'. This adds DIRECTORY, which should
be a complete, relative or absolute, path to the directory (for example
/usr/local/share/RPGE/scm or ../), to the scheme paths. A similar
facility exists for sprites, so the default sprites can be found by
simply referencing them by name. To add an image search directory, use
the directive `image-dir:DIRECTORY', which acts like the scheme-dir
directive.

   Since several common files and directories may be loaded and
declared very often, RPGE provides an include directive to tell RPGE to
load another configuration file. This does not use any paths yet, so
when using it, the path passed to it should be a complete path to the
other configuration file. Syntactically, the directive is
`include:FILE'.  To deal with the problem of loading the default
libraries on startup, RPGE's build system builds a default
configuration file for you using sed. This file is located in
conf/default.conf, relative to the RPGE source directory.  This file is
installed on your system by make install and sets up the default scheme
directories, image directories and libraries. RPGE also makes a
skeleton configuration file, conf/skeleton.conf, for you, which
includes default.conf and loads the testing game, test.scm. Loading
RPGE with this file (using for example `src/RPGE -f conf/skeleton.conf'
in the top source directory after running make), will fail until make
install has run.  This is intentional, as the file is meant to make it
easy to work with the included files in any RPGE installation.

3 RPGE's view of the world
**************************

* Menu:

* Overview::
* Tiles::
* Mobs::


File: rpge.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Tiles,  Prev: RPGE's view of the world,  Up: RPGE's view of the world

3.1 Overview
============

In RPGE, a world is essentially a flat, 2-dimensional surface, divided
into tiles. These tiles are small, rectangular areas, with configurable
widths and heights.  On these tiles, objects called mobs can move
around in any way they wish, possibly blocked by certain tiles while
freely passing over others.  These mobs are each rendered as a
so-called sprite, a 2-dimensional picture. The picture to render is
determined by the file loaded for the mob and its animation status.

   In the future, this model could be expanded to allow any number of
concurrent 'worlds' on a single RPGE instance, something that could be
especially useful if RPGE were ever networked. At present though, there
is only one world and parallel universes are merely science-fiction.


File: rpge.info,  Node: Tiles,  Next: Mobs,  Prev: Overview,  Up: RPGE's view of the world

3.2 Tiles
=========

RPGE tiles need a little more discussion, since they have some
interesting properties that users may want to be aware of. First, all
tiles in the tilegrid are independent.  Changing the data of a single
tile does not change the data of the others, with one important
exception. The one exception is that changing the image data used by a
tile directly (something only possible through either runtime reloading
of images or modifying the RPGE source, there is no API function)
changes the image data used by all tiles using the image of the same
filename and index.

   Second, RPGE differentiates between the various directions a mob
arrives at a tile from. For example, if a mob is moving right when it
hits a blocking tile, that tile will only block if the BLOCK_LEFT flag
is set. Similarly, for a mob arriving at any tile, the blocking flag
for the corresponding edge is checked.

   Third, RPGE has the facilities in place to differentiate between two
types of mobs (dubbed 'ground' and 'air' mobs) and block none, one or
both of those. However, these flags are unused at the time of writing.

   Fourth, though RPGE does check for tile blocking while a mob is
moving, mobs moving over tiles while they are being changed may cause
some bugs. For example, a mob moving over a tile that does not block
while it is being modified to block will probably proceed to move over
the tile anyway, as blocking was checked when the mob entered the tile
and will not be checked when the mob leaves it.


File: rpge.info,  Node: Mobs,  Prev: Tiles,  Up: RPGE's view of the world

3.3 Mobs
========

Mobs, like tiles, have some interesting properties. The most important
of these is the ability to add any data you want to any mob you want.
This data, dubbed the 'mob user data ', can be queried and set from
GUILE. By default, it is the empty list marker and protected from the
garbage collector. Since RPGE only allows a single GUILE value of user
data for every mob, it is recommended to fill this space with a list,
table or other compound data structure so you can put arbitrarily large
amounts of data in this space. The example statistics system and other
systems that work with mob user data will presume this data is a table.
It is also worth noting that the default mob bootstrap procedure sets
this data to an empty table.

   This bootstrap procedure is another property of mobs that users can
use to enhance mobs. Since systems using mob user data may need
initialization, RPGE provides this procedure, which is called by the
GUILE procedure make-mob only, not by the primitive create-mob, to set
the initial value of this data. The procedure may however do any
arbitrary amount of processing or data creation, as long as it takes a
single argument representing the mob being created.

   Closer to the C side of things, mobs are currently considered as
wide and as high as a single tile. Therefore, RPGE will render sprites
of SPRITE_WIDTH width and SPRITE_HEIGHT height, both of those macros
being equal to the respective dimensions of tiles. When determining
what sprite to render, RPGE looks up the image data associated with the
image index given in the mob (images are loaded globally in RPGE, to
save space) and takes a rect of the specified width and height,
starting at a starting point determined by the current animation of the
mob. Animations are laid out horizontally in the image data, being
right next to each other and SPRITE_WIDTH wide each. Individual frames
of a certain animation are in its column, right below each other with
no padding. Essentially, RPGE treats the image data as a frame grid,
indexed in the horizontal direction by the index of the mob's current
animation and in the vertical direction by the index of the mob's
current frame. Animations can loop automatically if that is desired.

   In addition to being animated, mobs can move. RPGE provides two
primitives for making mobs move, the generic move-mob which immediately
changes the direction and movement of a mob, regardless of any current
velocity. Since this is not very practical if you want mobs to move
along a path specified by keying it in asynchronously, RPGE natively
supports queueing up movements, which is done using mob-add-movement.
If the mob is not moving, this procedure has the same effect as
move-mob. Otherwise, the movement is queued up in a FIFO buffer, the
first element of which is started when the mob is done with its current
movement, and so on. This buffer is not cleared by calls to move-mob.
If mobs collide however, the buffer is instantly cleared on both
colliding mobs. The rationale behind this is that RPGE should wait for
users to issue new commands, since a collision implicitly is a result
of being unable to execute movement commands.

   Finally, mobs support RPGE's event mechanism, which is currently
hardly being used. In the future, this could be used to send an event
whenever a mob completes a motion or, more generally, changes its
motion. This would be useful for animation purposes.

4 Communication in RPGE
***********************

In RPGE, there are two kinds of communication, being communication
between RPGE itself and the scripts running in it and communication
between the scripts themselves.  The latter type of communication can
be handled in any way the users want, just like in any multithreaded
program. Communication between RPGE and the engine is not so freeform,
but is similar to communication in GTK, Xlib or a similar system.

   This communication is handled by so-called events, which live on
things called 'eventstacks'. Regardless of the specific stack, events
themselves are simple messages, basically consisting of something to
identify the particular type of message and whatever the user should
know about it.

   Another property of eventstacks one should be aware of is that they
need to be opened before usage. Once opened, it is guaranteed that the
user receives any event that arrives after the stack was opened. A
stack without users does not accumulate any events at all. Regardless
of this last property, it is advised to add any useful event to the
appropriate stack, even if users are not guaranteed.

   Stacks themselves live in RPGE, being assigned to either a certain
object or just being global. There is currently one global stack and
every single mob has a stack of its own. Global stacks should be used
for events that are not related to anything that has a stack of its own
and is a single object, for example a collision between two mobs or a
keypress. Stacks assigned to the object are for events related to the
object exclusively, for example an event sent when a mob moves across a
tile boundary.

* Event Reference::


File: rpge.info,  Node: Event Reference,  Prev: Communication in RPGE,  Up: Communication in RPGE

4.1 Event Reference
===================

This section lists all current events. Note that events, to GUILE, are
pairs whose car holds data identifying the particular type of event and
whose cdr holds data associated with the specific event itself.

   Global events:
   * key-down:This event specifies a keypress. The car is the symbol
     'key-down, the cdr is a symbol indicating the key pressed.
     Usually, this is the letter typed by pressing  this particular
     key. For example, if the a key is pressed without holding down
     shift, the cdr of the associated event will hold the symbol 'a.
     Newlines, tabs  and spaces are converted to 'newline, 'tab and
     'space, respectively.

   * collision:This event indicates a collision between two mobs. Its
     car is the symbol 'collision, its cdr is a pair, holding the two
     mobs that collided, in no particular order.


   Mob events:
   * tile-change:This event is sent whenever a mob (technically a mob's
     center) crosses a tile boundary. Its car is the symbol
     'tile-change, its cdr is a pair of pairs, whose car holds a pair
     of the x and y coordinates (in tile coordinates) the mob had and
     whose cdr holds a pair of the new x and y coordinates.

Appendix A API Reference
************************

This section describes the entire RPGE GUILE API, all the way from
primitives to the stuff implemented in the examples that are part of
the RPGE distribution.

* Menu:

* Primitives::
* Scheme-level APIs::


File: rpge.info,  Node: Primitives,  Next: Scheme-level APIs,  Prev: API Reference,  Up: API Reference

A.1 Primitives
==============

Primitives related to mobs:
   * `(create-mob X Y SPRITE)':

     Creates a mob on the tilegrid at point (X,Y). Note that X and Y
     are tile coordinates, not pixel coordinates. The mob is rendered
     using SPRITE, specified as a string containing the filename of the
     sprite to be loaded. Animation data and the like are defaulted to
     zero.

   * `(move-mob MOB X Y FRAMES)':

     Move MOB, over FRAMES frames, X tiles to the right and Y tiles
     down. This modifies the movement data of the mob, canceling any
     current movement.

   * `(add-mob-movement MOB X Y FRAMES)':

     Queue up the movement that would be done by the mob if move-mob
     was called with the same arguments. Queued up movements are
     executed in order once the mob is done moving.

   * `(set-mob-animation MOB ANIMATION START TARGET FRAMESBETWEEN
     LOOP)':

     Animate MOB, using animation ANIMATION, starting at frame START,
     ending at frame TARGET, changing to the next frame every
     FRAMESBETWEEN frames.  If LOOP is true, the animation loops until
     stopped. Note that frames and animations are specified by indices,
     which start at zero.

   * `(stop-mob-animation MOB)'

     Immediately stop the animation of MOB in its current state.

   * `(get-mob-data MOB)'

     Returns the piece of global data associated with MOB.

   * `(set-mob-data MOB VALUE)'

     Set the piece of global data associated with MOB to VALUE.

   * `(open-mob-events MOB)'

     Open the eventstack of MOB and return the user index associated
     with this action.

   * `(get-mob-event MOB USER)'

     Get the next event on MOB for USER, in which USER is an index
     returned by open-mob-events.

   * `(close-mob-evetns MOB USER)'

     Close the eventstack on MOB for USER, indicating that USER does
     not want to receive any new events on this stack.

   * `(destroy-mob MOB)'

     Destroy MOB.


   Primitives related to tiles and grids thereof:

   * `(create-tile SPRITE CLIPPING-RECT BLOCKING)'

     Creates a tile, using SPRITE as the filename to load a sprite
     from, CLIPPING-RECT as a list representing a rectangular clipping
     area, containing the part of the sprite image that should be used
     for rendering, and BLOCKING as an identifier indicating which mobs
     are blocked.  The types of blocking RPGE currently checks for are
     block-<direction>, where direction is left, right up or down. The
     particular direction indicates the edge the mob to be blocked
     hits, i.e. a tile with block-right for BLOCKING blocks mobs
     attempting to cross its right edge.  There is a single combined
     constant combining all four directions, conveniently named
     block-all-directions. Other variations can be obtained by simply
     adding individual constants.

   * `(init-tilegrid WIDTH HEIGHT)'

     Resets the main tilegrid to a new grid of dimensions WIDTH and
     HEIGHT. This should be called once, when initializing the game map.
     Note that the tilegrid created by this procedure does not have any
     tiles set and all tiles should be set manually.

   * `(set-tile X Y TILE)'

     Sets the tile at (X,Y) to TILE.

   * `(set-all-tiles TILE)'

     Sets all tiles to TILE.


   Primitives related to windows:

   * `(create-window WIDTH HEIGHT X Y SPRITE SPRITEWIDTH SPRITEHEIGHT)'

     Creates a window WIDTH pixels wide and HEIGHT pixels high, with
     its top-left corner at (X,Y) (in pixel coordinates). The window is
     filled with a rectangular tile, SPRITEWIDTH pixels wide and
     SPRITEHEIGHT pixels wide, taken from the image file SPRITE. Note
     that the tile is hardwired to have its top-left corner at (0,0).

   * `(remove-window WINDOW)'

     Destroys WINDOW.


   Font-related primitives:

   * `(open-font FILENAME SIZE)'

     Opens the font referenced by FILENAME, with a font size of SIZE.

   * `(close-font FONT)'

     Closes FONT.


   Text-related primitives:

   * `(make-text X Y TEXT FONT RED GREEN BLUE)'

     Create floating text at pixel coordinates (X,Y), rendering TEXT,
     using FONT. The text is rendered in the color specified by
     RED,GREEN and BLUE, where each variable represents the intensity
     of the color that is its namesake, on a scale from 0 to 255,
     inclusive.

   * `(destroy-text TEXT)'

     Destroy TEXT.


   Primitives controlling the main camera:

   * `(get-camera-x)'

   * `(get-camera-y)'

     These return the x and y-coordinates, respectively, of the main
     camera, in tile coordinates.

   * `(set-camera-x X)'

   * `(set-camera-y Y)'

     Set the coordinates of the main camera, in tile coordinates.


   Global miscellaneous primitives:

   * `(get-global-data)'

     Returns the current value of the global data stored inside RPGE.

   * `(set-global-data VALUE)'

     Sets the current value of the global data, while protecting it
     from the garbage collector. This should be called with something
     like a list or a table, so it can be shared across scripts. The
     default scripts set this to a table and store data in that.

   * `(open-global-events)'

     Opens the global eventstack, returning a user index.

   * `(get-global-event USER)'

     Returns the next global event in line for USER.

   * `(close-global-events USER)'

     Closes the global eventstack for USER.

   * `(get-argv)'

     Gets the current argument vector of the thread, roughly presumed
     to be equal to the 'arguments' the script was 'called' with.

   * `(load-with-argv SCRIPT ARGLIST)'

     Execute SCRIPT in the current thread, passing it ARGLIST as its
     arguments.

   * `(safe-load SCRIPT)'

     Load SCRIPT safely, that is, avoid crashes due to concurrent load
     starts and ends.

A.2 Scheme-level APIs
=====================

In addition to the primitives defined by the RPGE core, the default
RPGE initialization file loads several files that define many Scheme
functions for use with RPGE. Usually, these are meant to provide
functionality that the developers felt shouldn't be 'hardcoded' in RPGE
and can be replaced by an equivalent built on either GUILE itself or a
combination of GUILE and the RPGE primitives described in the previous
section.

   In the default initialization file, files are ordered in such a way
that, at the very least, they will be loaded after their dependencies
have been loaded. Therefore, if you replace files, it is recommended to
check if files loaded after the deleted file will still load and the
functions they define will still run. For example, not loading
table.guile , which is referenced at the very start of the default
initialization file, will break most functions in files loaded later,
with the exception of utils.guile, which does not use any tables at all.

   This section lists the APIs in the order in which they are loaded by
default, roughly the order in which they depend on each other.

   Table API (defined in table.guile):
   * `(init-table)' Returns a fresh, initialized table.

   * `(table? TABLE)' Returns #t if TABLE looks like a table. This
     function is not perfectly accurate.

   * `(add-to-table TABLE KEY VALUE)' Returns TABLE, with KEY bound to
     VALUE. This does not modify the original TABLE.

   * `(add-to-table! TABLE KEY VALUE)' Returns TABLE, modified to
     include KEY bound to VALUE.

   * `(get-from-table TABLE KEY)' Returns the value KEY is bound to in
     TABLE.

   * `(set-in-table! TABLE KEY VALUE)' Bind KEY to VALUE in
     TABLE,modifying it. Returns 'error if KEY is not bound in TABLE.

   * `(multi-key-find-with-list TABLE KEYLIST)' Returns the value bound
     to the keylist in TABLE. Essentially, for a list of length n, this
     returns the value bound to the successive members of the list in
     TABLE and n-1 sub tables. On error, this returns '() if a table
     does not contain the right key and 'error if one of the sub tables
     is not a table.

   * `(multi-key-find TABLE . keys)' The same as the above, but using
     the rest argument keys as the key list.

   * `(multi-key-add! TABLE KEYLIST VALUE)' Using the same conventions
     for sub tables as the above two functions, add VALUE to a subtable
     of TABLE.

   * `(multi-key-set! TABLE KEYLIST VALUE)' Using the same sub table
     conventions, modify the value in a subtable of TABLE,  setting it
     to VALUE.

   * `(remove-from-table! TABLE KEY)' Modifies TABLE, removing the
     binding of KEY.


   Key binding API (defined in keys.scm):

   * `(bind-key KEY PROC)' Add a new binding, binding KEY to PROC,
     where PROC is a procedure of no arguments.

   * `(get-binding KEY)' Get the procedure bound to KEY, or '() if none
     can be found.

   * `(remove-binding KEY)' Undo the current binding to KEY.


   Mob event API (defined in mob_events.scm):

   * `(mob-tracking-init)' Initialize mob event handling.

   * `(add-tracked-mob! MOB)' Make the mob event system track MOB,
     handling events on this mob.

   * `(remove-tracked-mob! MOB)' Make the mob event system stop
     tracking MOB.

   * `(init-mob-bindings MOB)' Initialize event binding for MOB.

   * `(bind-mob-event MOB EVENT PROC)' Bind EVENT to PROC on MOB. PROC
     should be a procedure of 1 argument, the event sent by RPGE, which
     is a pair of a type (usually a symbol) and some associated data.

   * `(execute-mob-binding MOB EVENT)' Execute the procedure bound to
     EVENT for MOB, passing it the event. Note that for this procedure,
     EVENT should contain the full event sent by RPGE, but while
     binding, it should contain the type data for the event.


   Mob bootstrapping API (defined in mobutils.scm):

   * `(get-mob-bootstrap-proc)' Returns the current mob bootstrap
     procedure, or '() if none was defined.

   * `(set-mob-bootstrap-proc! proc)' Set current mob bootstrap proc to
     proc, or define it to proc if it was not defined yet.

   * `(make-mob X Y SPRITE)' Make a mob using create-mob, passing it
     the arguments passed. Then, apply the mob boostrap procedure, if
     any, to the newly made mob.  This procedure should be used
     whenever you 'just want to make a mob'. Use create-mob only if you
     have an explicit reason to avoid bootstrapping.


   Mob statistics API (defined in stats.scm):

   * `(stats-init MOB)' Initialize the statistics system on the mob.
     Like many default procedures, this relies on the mob data being a
     valid table.  It is recommended to call this and related
     procedures in the mob bootstrap procedure.

   * `(get-stat MOB STAT)' Get the value of STAT for MOB. If STAT is
     not set, this returns '().

   * `(set-stat MOB STAT VALUE)' Set the value of STAT to VALUE for
     MOB. If STAT is not set, this implicitly defines it.

   * `(procedural-stats-init)' Initialize the procedural stats system.
     This requires that the global userdata is a valid table.

   * `(add-procedural-stat-proc! STAT PROC)' Add STAT as a procedural
     stat, meaning that get-stat will call PROC on the mob passed to
     get-stat if STAT is requested.

   * `(get-stat-proc STAT)' Returns the procedure used to calculate
     STAT.

   * `(remove-procedural-stat-proc! STAT)' Remove the procedure bound
     to STAT. After this, STAT will be looked up by value on the mob,
     rather than being calculated using a procedure.


   The above APIs usually have initialization procedures, which need to
be called before using them. If the description of such a procedure
does not mention any other constraints, it should be presumed that the
global userdata needs to be a table and, for procedures that initialize
something for a mob, the mob's user data must be a valid table as well.

******************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
