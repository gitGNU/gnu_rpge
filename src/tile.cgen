  For now, let's lock a single mutex for any tilegrid operation, to at least 
  make the system thread-safe. Research and testing should be done to figure
  out exactly what would be the best arrangement of locks. The real problem
  here is that the 'ideal' arrangement of locks could probably be modeled
  as a rather complicated mathematical function of the specific usage rpge's
  put to. Put simply, there's probably no ideal general-purpose locking 
  strategy, but we should at least try to find something decent.
