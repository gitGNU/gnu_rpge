This file records all known RPGE limitations and bugs. Any bugs herein are things that may need urgent attention.

-RPGE's build system still breaks make distcheck for the same old reasons, but it is now less ugly. However, it still uses the GNU sed extensions \U and \E, for aesthetic reasons.

-The GUILE API related to fonts, texts and windows is not powerful enough. Furthermore, the mob animation API needs work.

-There is no way for scripts to know when mobs stop moving or change their movement, should this exist anyway?

-For future purposes: RPGE users cannot arbitrarily swap around engine states yet. Of course, such a feature is highly dangerous, very thread-unsafe and generally pretty hard to use, but extra-ordinarily powerful. For example, it would allow one to do game saves by literally dumping the state of the engine to a file. Such a trick however requires a new layer of objectization, which allows any or almost any RPGE object to be 'transliterated' into a GUILE representation. If done improperly, this would be insanely slow.
