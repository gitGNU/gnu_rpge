This file records all known RPGE limitations and bugs. Any bugs herein are things that may need urgent attention.

-RPGE's build system, implemented through convertors.sh and an automake suffix rule, is not generic enough. It depends on A: building RPGE
from the main source directory instead of a subdirectory not containing the sources (breaking make distcheck), B: GNU sed (usage of \U and \E)
C: gcc (usage of -c). B could be avoided by uglifying macros, but that is most definitely unaesthetic. A and C are both issues with 
Remco's understanding of automake. Currently, he hasn't figured out how to write a suffix rule in such a way that automake understands it 
does have multiple lines and bash doesn't choke on it even if it does happen to contain conditionals (apparently, bash doesn't like escaped
newlines in a conditional). Similarly, he hasn't figured out how to get Automake to be kind enough to just do what it usually does to turn .c 
files into .o files, with some extra preprocessing. The best way to do this would be adding hooks to suffix rules, but as is, it would be
quite nice to have $(COMPILE) just compile, without attempting to link.
Additional comment: It seems it does work from a subdirectory, but make distcheck just forces us to do absolutely, completely, 100% nothing to either the build dir or the source dir, not letting us create new files.

-The GUILE API related to fonts, texts and windows is not powerful enough. Furthermore, the mob animation API needs work.

-There is no way for scripts to know when mobs stop moving or change their movement, should this exist anyway?

-For future purposes: RPGE users cannot arbitrarily swap around engine states yet. Of course, such a feature is highly dangerous, very thread-unsafe and generally pretty hard to use, but extra-ordinarily powerful. For example, it would allow one to do game saves by literally dumping the state of the engine to a file. Such a trick however requires a new layer of objectization, which allows any or almost any RPGE object to be 'transliterated' into a GUILE representation. If done improperly, this would be insanely slow.
